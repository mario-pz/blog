# how to boost your daily energy

## stop morning caffeine and replace it with exercise

caffeine is a popular stimulant that can provide a quick boost of energy and help improve mental focus and alertness.
however, many people consume caffeine in a way that can actually be detrimental to their productivity and overall health.
drinking coffee right away in the morning, for example, can disrupt natural sleep patterns and lead to headaches and difficulty getting energy in the morning.
by replacing caffeine with natural energy boosters like <u>cold baths and jump rope</u>, you can avoid the negative side effects of caffeine and enjoy sustained energy and productivity throughout the day. 
while the first week of dropping caffeine can be challenging, with headaches and lack of energy, with patience and perseverance, these symptoms will eventually fade away.
after dropping caffeine for at least two months, you may find that you are able to drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages without experiencing negative effects, as long as you don't start frequently drinking it again.
