# some things before we start

* refrain from micromanaging, as it is an inefficient use of time and can negatively impact relationships and productivity

# avoid social media 

don't allow these digital leeches to feast on your attention and productivity. 
keep social media usage strictly need-based, such as reading important announcements or connecting with like-minded individuals on niche forums.
say no to pointless chitchat, attention-seeking behaviors, and toxic environments that only drain your mental energy and strain your eyes.
