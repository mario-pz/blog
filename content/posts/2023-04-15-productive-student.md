# how to boost your daily energy

## stop morning caffeine and replace it with exercise

![soy latte](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/159/767/af7.jpg)

caffeine is a popular stimulant that can provide a quick boost of energy and help improve mental focus and alertness.
however, many people consume caffeine in a way that can actually be detrimental to their productivity and overall health.
drinking coffee right away in the morning, for example, can disrupt natural sleep patterns and lead to headaches and difficulty getting energy in the morning.
by replacing caffeine with natural energy boosters like <u>cold baths and jump rope</u>, you can avoid the negative side effects of caffeine and enjoy sustained energy and productivity throughout the day. 
while the first week of dropping caffeine can be challenging, with headaches and lack of energy, with patience and perseverance, these symptoms will eventually fade away.
after dropping caffeine for at least two months, you may find that you are able to drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages without experiencing negative effects, as long as you don't start frequently drinking it again.

## meditate, meditate, meditate

meditation is effective for productivity because it helps cultivate mindfulness, focus, and emotional well-being. by training the mind to be present and aware, meditation improves concentration, allowing for better task engagement and reduced distraction. additionally, it can reduce stress and anxiety, which in turn boosts overall mood and cognitive functioning. In my opinion, do enough to rest your eyes and brain like 30 minutes to an hour nothing more around the afternoon.

## avoid social media 

Don't allow these digital leeches to feast on your attention and productivity. 
Keep social media usage strictly need-based, such as reading important announcements or connecting with like-minded individuals on niche forums.
Say no to pointless chitchat, attention-seeking behaviors, and toxic environments that only drain your mental energy and strain your eyes.

## identify and automate possible processes

don't waste a single second doing something that can possibly be automated, time is precious.
 by implementing automation, you'll free up valuable time and mental energy, allowing you to focus on high-priority tasks and creative problem-solving. invest in automation tools or learn scripting languages to make your workflow as seamless as possible, ultimately boosting your overall performance and effectiveness


## neovim 

neovim is a modern, feature-rich foss text editor that offers a vast array of powerful motion commands. these motions allow users to navigate through text blazingly fast, accurately, and efficiently without the need for a mouse or touchpad.
the importance of these motions in daily life cannot be overstated, especially for programmers and writers who spend hours working with text. by using neovim's motions, users can save time, reduce distractions, and improve their workflow, resulting in higher productivity and better results.
in contrast, using subpar editors can lead to wasted time and frustration. poorly implemented motion commands or a lack of customization options can slow down workflows, decrease productivity, and make the editing process more challenging and cumbersome.
therefore, for those who value their time and productivity, neovim's advanced motion system is an essential tool that can help streamline workflows and simplify the editing process.
