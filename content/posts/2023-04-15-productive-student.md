# how to improve your energy

## stop morning caffeine and replace with exercise

caffeine is a popular stimulant that can provide a quick boost of energy and help improve mental focus and alertness.
however, many people consume caffeine in a way that can actually be detrimental to their productivity and overall health.
drinking coffee right away in the morning, for example, can disrupt natural sleep patterns and lead to headaches and difficulty getting energy in the morning.
by replacing caffeine with natural energy boosters like cold baths and jump rope, you can avoid the negative side effects of caffeine and enjoy sustained energy and productivity throughout the day. 
while the first week of dropping caffeine can be challenging, with headaches and lack of energy, with patience and perseverance, these symptoms will eventually fade away.
after dropping caffeine for at least two months, you may find that you are able to drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages without experiencing negative effects, as long as you don't start frequently drinking it again.

## meditate, meditate, meditate

meditation is effective for productivity because it helps cultivate mindfulness, focus, and emotional well-being. by training the mind to be present and aware, meditation improves concentration, allowing for better task engagement and reduced distraction. additionally, it can reduce stress and anxiety, which in turn boosts overall mood and cognitive functioning. In my opinion, do enough to rest your eyes and brain like 30 minutes to an hour nothing more around the afternoon.

## stop unnecessary screen time 

this approach encourages a more balanced lifestyle and helps to prevent potential negative effects associated with excessive screen usage, such as eye strain, sleep disturbances, and decreased attention spans.
a great example that encourages eye strain and sleep disturbance is social media. avoid starting useless conversations and instead use it only when necessary for example reading announcements. if you want to do nasty things 
set the right day and right time for it. do not merge it in your weekday schedule.
