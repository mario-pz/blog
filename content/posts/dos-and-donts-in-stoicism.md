# do:

- practice self-control and discipline: train yourself to be mentally and emotionally resilient in the face of adversity and distractions.
- embrace the present moment: focus on the here and now, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.
- differentiate between what you can and cannot control: accept that some things are outside of your control, and focus your energy on the things you can change.
- practice virtue: cultivate qualities like wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance in your daily life, as these are the core tenets of stoic ethics.
- reflect on your actions and emotions: engage in daily self-examination and self-improvement to become a better person.
- use reason to guide your actions: make well-thought-out decisions rather than acting on impulse or emotion.
- seek tranquility and contentment: aim for a balanced life, free from excessive desires and fears, to achieve inner peace.

# dont:

- be a slave to your emotions: avoid letting negative emotions like anger, envy, or fear dictate your actions or control your life.
- be attached to material possessions: recognize that material things are temporary and that true happiness comes from within.
- be driven by external validation: do not rely on the opinions of others for your self-worth or happiness.
- be afraid to let go of unhealthy relationships or situations: prioritize your well-being and inner peace over maintaining connections that harm you.
- procrastinate or waste time: be mindful of how you spend your time, and make the most of the present moment.
- be discouraged by setbacks: treat failures and obstacles as opportunities to learn and grow.
- compare yourself to others: focus on your own personal growth and self-improvement, rather than competing with or envying others.
