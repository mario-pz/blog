# do

- foster a culture of collaboration: encourage communication and collaboration among development, operations, and other teams to build trust and streamline workflows.
- automate processes: use tools and technologies that automate repetitive tasks, such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, to increase efficiency and reduce human errors.
- implement ci/cd: regularly integrate code changes, build, test, and deploy applications to catch issues early and ensure a smooth delivery.
- use version control: keep track of changes to your codebase, configuration files, and documentation with a version control system like git.
- monitor and measure: establish key performance indicators to monitor application performance, system health, and the effectiveness of your devops processes.
- prioritize security: integrate security into every step of the development lifecycle and automate security testing and compliance checks.
- learn from failures: encourage a blameless post-mortem culture and use incidents to learn, improve processes, and avoid future mistakes.

# don't

- ignore the human aspect: devops is not only about tools and automation; it's also about fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
- overload the pipeline: resist the temptation to automate everything at once; instead, prioritize and focus on the most critical and time-consuming tasks.
- skip testing: cutting corners on testing may lead to software defects, security vulnerabilities, and other issues that can impact the application's performance and stability.
- neglect feedback loops: ensure that feedback from end-users, developers, and operations teams is incorporated into the development and deployment processes.
- work in silos: avoid having teams work independently; promote communication and collaboration across the organization to maximize the benefits of devops.
- focus only on short-term gains: devops transformation takes time and effort, so be prepared for a long-term commitment and avoid chasing quick wins at the expense of sustainable improvements.
