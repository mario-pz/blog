# software 
its best practise to implement the circuit on a realistic simulator and then reproduce on hardware to avoid any explosions or fires. ðŸ’£

* multisim if the university forced you to use it

### learn how to take care of your soldering iron first

watch the video if you don't know how to take care of the tip, not doing so will result in a useless tip,

* https://youtu.be/JADI1N-K9Yc

always, take to account. the more you solder the better you will become, so don't worry if your soldering is unwatchable

* soldering iron https://grobotronics.com/zd-35n-30w.html (â‚¬9.90)
* soldering station (includes a wired sponge) https://grobotronics.com/zd-10w.html (â‚¬9.90)
* sponge https://grobotronics.com/soldering-sponge-51x36mm.html (â‚¬0.4000)
* lead free https://grobotronics.com/cynel-100g-0.5mm-lead-free.html (â‚¬9.90)
* flux (will be added in the future)

### breakdown of the cost 

* breadboard: â‚¬4.20
* micro usb or type c cable: â‚¬2
* jumper wires (pack of 10): â‚¬1.80
* led lights assorted kit: â‚¬6.90
* metal resistor assortment kit (525 pcs): â‚¬6.40
* soldering iron: â‚¬9.90
* soldering station: â‚¬9.90
* soldering sponge: â‚¬0.40
* lead-free solder (100g, 0.5mm): â‚¬9.90

the total cost for these items would be â‚¬50.40.
please note that these prices may be subject to change and do not include shipping costs.

# what can you build 

make a led blink, make a traffic light like i did, a rc car? a keyboard? that's up to you. 
google what components they need, start building.
