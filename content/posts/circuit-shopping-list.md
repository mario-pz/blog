# software 
its best practise to implement the circuit on a realistic simulator and then reproduce on hardware to avoid any explosions or fires. 💣

* multisim if the university forced you to use it
* https://www.circuitlab.com/
* kicad for pcb design https://www.kicad.org/download/

### learn how to take care of your soldering iron first

* https://youtu.be/JADI1N-K9Yc

always, take to account. the more you solder the better you will become, so don't worry if your soldering is unwatchable

* soldering iron https://grobotronics.com/zd-35n-30w.html (€9.90)
* soldering station (includes a wired sponge) https://grobotronics.com/zd-10w.html (€9.90)
* sponge https://grobotronics.com/soldering-sponge-51x36mm.html (€0.4000)
* lead free https://grobotronics.com/cynel-100g-0.5mm-lead-free.html (€9.90)
* flux (will be added in the future)

### breakdown of the cost 

* breadboard: €4.20
* micro usb or type c cable: €2
* jumper wires (pack of 10): €1.80
* led lights assorted kit: €6.90
* metal resistor assortment kit (525 pcs): €6.40
* soldering iron: €9.90
* soldering station: €9.90
* soldering sponge: €0.40
* lead-free solder (100g, 0.5mm): €9.90

the total cost for these items would be €50.40.
please note that these prices may be subject to change and do not include shipping costs.

# what can you build 

make a led blink, make a traffic light like i did, a rc car? a keyboard? that's up to you. 
google what components they need and start building.
