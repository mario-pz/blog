**manual deployments**: relying on manual processes for deploying applications can lead to inconsistencies, delays, and errors.

**snowflake environments**: unique, hand-crafted environments that are difficult to reproduce and maintain, making it hard to track and fix issues.

**hero culture**: over-reliance on specific individuals to solve problems, which can lead to bottlenecks and burnout.

**reactive mindset**: focusing on fixing issues as they arise rather than proactively preventing them through automation and monitoring.

**monolithic applications**: large, tightly-coupled applications that are difficult to update, test, and deploy independently, which slows down the overall development and deployment processes.

**undocumented processes**: lack of proper documentation for processes, tools, and systems, making it hard for team members to understand and maintain them.

**resistance to change**: failure to adapt and embrace new practices, technologies, and methodologies that can help improve the devops processes.
